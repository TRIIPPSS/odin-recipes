<h3>Pollo A La Brasa: the <em>Peruvian</em> roasted chicken dish that conquered a nation</h3>
<p>A roasted chicken dish accompanied by thick french fries, a fresh salad, and dipping sauces.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken</li>
    <li>½ cup plain vinegar</li>
    <li>½ cup ground ají panca chilli pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup freshly made garlic paste</li>
    <li>½ cup dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>2½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Salt, ground black pepper, and cumin</li>
    <li>6 large white cooking potatoes</li>
    <li>1 small head iceberg lettuce</li>
    <li>3 medium tomatoes</li>
    <li>½ cucumber</li>
    <li>½ cup salad dressing</li>
    <li>5 tbsp Dipping sauces Mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard and ají chilli pepper dip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aji Amarillo Sauce</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 large aji amarillo pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 cup queso fresco</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large garlic clove</li>
    <li>3 tbsp lime juice</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp huacatay paste</li>
    <li>1 pinch sugar</li>
    <li>pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>On the night before roasting, add dry ground ingredients to bowl</li>
    <li>Combine all the ingredients for the marinade (vinegar, soy sauce, vegetable oil, black beer, ground ají panca chilli pepper, garlic, coarse salt, pepper and cumin) in a large bowl and mix well.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken in a large baking tray or bowl, pour the marinade over it, ensuring it covers all of the parts of the chicken, and leave in the fridge overnight to marinate.</li>
    <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge, spread the marinade over the chicken one last time and place into a baking pan, adding 1 inch of water to the bottom of the pan in order to avoid the chicken drying out. Pre-heat the oven at 390°F (200 °C) for 10 minutes and place the tray with the chicken in the middle of the oven. Bake for 2 hours or until cooked, ensuring the chicken is cooked inside (check with a skewer) and the skin is nicely roasted and crispy.</li>
    <li>About 30 minutes before the chicken is ready to come out of the oven, fry the potatoes in plenty of vegetable oil until golden brown. Place on some kitchen towel in a strainer on a plate to absorb any excess oil. Add salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Place the lettuce, tomato and cucumber and toss with your salad dressing of choice.</li>
    <li>When the chicken is ready, cut into individual pieces (usually quartered) and serve with the French fries, salad, and dipping sauces.</li>
